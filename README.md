## How to install

The application is not available for download from the App Store, but can be installed without it by following one of the methods below:

### With Xcode

**To use this method you need to have Xcode installed and an Apple developer account.**

1. Clone the Git Repository with the following command or download the ZIP file from the latest Relase.

`git clone https://github.com/Isaaker/Ghost_Simulator_iOS-iPadOS.git`

2. Open the file ghost_archery_sim.xcodeproj with Xcode

3. If you do not have it enabled yet, activate the developer mode of your device from Settings > Privacy and Security > Developer Mode

4. Connect with a cable your device to the Mac with Xcode

5. Make sure you have trusted the device if you are connecting it to that Mac for the first time

6. Go to the project root (the master file) and open Singing & Capabilities Menu

7. Sign the application with your Apple Developer certificate

8. Run the App with Command+R or Product > Run

9. When the application already exits the device, press the stop button, close Xcode and disconnect the device

10. You now have the application installed but you will need to authorize the application developer for the application to run. You can do this from Settings > General > VPN and device management > Developer's app

11. Now the app works!!!
